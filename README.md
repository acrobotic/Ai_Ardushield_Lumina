Overview
---
This repository includes the Eagle design files (schematics and layout) for our
[WS2812 RGB LED Shield for the Arduino Uno][1]. The shield design is based on the
popular WS2812 'smart' LED package, which contains an embedded, costant-current
LED driver (the WS2811).

The shield includes **40 WS2812 LEDs in a 5x8 array configuration**. But, contrary to a traditional
LED matrix, the shield uses a single data line (Digital Pin 8) from the 
Arduino to control brightness and color!  The shield also includes a power 
terminal for using an external supply.

The firmware files along with code samples are also included in this
repository.
